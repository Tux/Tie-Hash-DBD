       Tie::Hash::DBD - tie a plain hash to a database table

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
         use DBI;
         use Tie::Hash::DBD;

         my $dbh = DBI->connect ("dbi:Pg:", ...);

         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", "dbi:SQLite:dbname=db.tie";
         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", $dbh;
         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", $dbh, {
             tbl => "t_tie_analysis",
             key => "h_key",
             fld => "h_value",
             str => "Storable",
             trh => 0,
             };

         $hash{key} = $value;  # INSERT
         $hash{key} = 3;       # UPDATE
         delete $hash{key};    # DELETE
         $value = $hash{key};  # SELECT
         %hash = ();           # CLEAR

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This module has been created to act as a drop-in replacement for
       modules that tie straight perl hashes to disk, like "DB_File". When the
       running system does not have enough memory to hold large hashes, and
       disk-tieing won't work because there is not enough space, it works
       quite well to tie the hash to a database, which preferable runs on a
       different server.

       This module ties a hash to a database table using [1monly [22ma "key" and a
       "value" field. If no tables specification is passed, this will create a
       temporary table with "h_key" for the key field and a "h_value" for the
       value field.

       I think it would make sense  to merge the functionality that this
       module provides into "Tie::DBI".

[1mtie[0m
       The tie call accepts two arguments:

   [1mDatabase[0m
       The first argument is the connection specifier.  This is either and
       open database handle or a "DBI_DSN" string.

       If this argument is a valid handle, this module does not open a
       database all by itself, but uses the connection provided in the handle.

       If the first argument is a scalar, it is used as DSN for DBI->connect
       ().

       Supported DBD drivers include DBD::Pg, DBD::SQLite, DBD::CSV,
       DBD::MariaDB, DBD::mysql, DBD::Oracle, DBD::Unify, and DBD::Firebird.
       Note that due to limitations they won't all perform equally well.
       Firebird is not tested anymore.

       DBD::Pg and DBD::SQLite have an unexpected great performance when
       server is the local system. DBD::SQLite is even almost as fast as
       DB_File.

       The current implementation appears to be extremely slow for CSV, as
       expected, MariaDB/mysql, and Unify. For Unify and MariaDB/mysql that is
       because these do not allow indexing on the key field so they cannot be
       set to be primary key.

       When using DBD::CSV with Text::CSV_XS version 1.02 or newer, it might
       be wise to disable utf8 encoding (only supported as of DBD::CSV-0.48):

        "dbi:CSV:f_ext=.csv/r;csv_null=1;csv_decode_utf8=0"

   [1mOptions[0m
       The second argument is optional and should - if passed - be a hashref
       to options. The following options are recognized:

       tbl
         Defines the name of the table to be used. If none is passed, a new
         table is created with a unique name like "t_tie_dbdh_42253_1". When
         possible, the table is created as [4mtemporary[24m. After the session, this
         table will be dropped.

         If a table name is provided, it will be checked for existence. If
         found, it will be used with the specified "key" and "fld".  Otherwise
         it will be created with "key" and "fld", but it will not be dropped
         at the end of the session.

         If a table name is provided, "AutoCommit" will be "On" for
         persistence, unless you provide a true "trh" attribute.

       key
         Defines the name of the key field in the database table.  The default
         is "h_key".

       ktp
         Defines the type of the key field in the database table.  The default
         is depending on the underlying database. Probably unwise to change.

         If the database allows the type to be indexed, the key field is
         defined as primary key.

         Note that if your data conflicts with internal (database)limits, like
         having a key that is longer than what the index on a primary key
         permits, you should probably want to create the table yourself with a
         different index or field type.

       fld
         Defines the name of the value field in the database table.   The
         default is "h_value".

       vtp
         Defines the type of the fld field in the database table.  The default
         is depending on the underlying database and most likely some kind of
         BLOB.

       str
         Defines the required persistence module.   Currently supports the use
         of "Storable", "Sereal",  "JSON", "JSON::Syck",  "YAML", "YAML::Syck"
         and "XML::Dumper".

         The default is undefined.

         Passing any other value will cause a "croak".

         If you want to preserve Encoding on the hash values, you should use
         this feature. (except where "PV8" has a "-" in the table below)

         Here is a table of supported data types given a data structure like
         this:

             my %deep = (
                 UND => undef,
                 IV  => 1,
                 NV  => 3.14159265358979,
                 PV  => "string",
                 PV8 => "ab\ncd\x{20ac}\t",
                 PVM => $!,
                 RV  => \$DBD,
                 AR  => [ 1..2 ],
                 HR  => { key => "value" },
                 OBJ => ( bless { auto_diag => 1 }, "Text::CSV_XS" ),
                 RX  => qr{^re[gG]e?x},
                 FMT => *{$::{STDOUT}}{FORMAT},
                 CR  => sub { "code"; },
                 GLB => *STDERR,
                 IO  => *{$::{STDERR}}{IO},
                 );

                       UND  IV  NV  PV PV8 PVM  RV  AR  HR OBJ  RX FMT  CR GLB  IO
          No streamer   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   -   -   -   -   -
          Storable      x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   -   -   -   -   -
          Sereal        x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   -   -   -
          JSON          x   x   x   x   x   x   -   x   x   -   -   -   -   -   -
          JSON::Syck    x   x   x   x   x   -   -   x   x   x   -   x   -   -   -
          YAML          x   x   x   x   x   -   x   x   x   x   x   x   -   -   -
          YAML::Syck    x   x   x   x   x   -   x   x   x   x   -   x   -   -   -
          XML::Dumper   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   x   -   x   -   -   -
          FreezeThaw    x   x   x   x   -   x   x   x   x   x   -   x   -   x   -
          Bencode       -   x   x   x   -   x   -   x   x   -   -   -   -   x   -

         So, "Storable" does not support persistence of types "CODE",
         "REGEXP", "FORMAT", "IO", and "GLOB". Be sure to test if all of your
         data types are supported by the serializer you choose. YMMV.

         "No streamer"  might work inside the current process if reference
         values are stored, but it is highly unlikely they are persistent.

         Also note that this module does not yet support dynamic deep
         structures.  See Nesting and deep structures.

       trh
         Use transaction Handles. By default none of the operations is guarded
         by transaction handling for speed reasons. Set "trh" to a true value
         cause all actions to be surrounded by  "begin_work" and "commit".
         Note that this may have a big impact on speed.

   [1mEncoding[0m
       "Tie::Hash::DBD" stores keys and values as binary data. This means that
       all Encoding and magic is lost when the data is stored, and thus is
       also not available when the data is restored,  hence all internal
       information about the data is also lost, which includes the "UTF8"
       flag.

       If you want to preserve the "UTF8" flag you will need to store internal
       flags and use the streamer option:

         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", { str => "Storable" };

       If you do not want the performance impact of Storable just to be able
       to store and retrieve UTF-8 values, there are two ways to do so:

         # Use utf-8 from database
         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", "dbi:Pg:", { vtp => "text" };
         $hash{foo} = "The teddybear costs \x{20ac} 45.95";

         # use Encode
         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", "dbi:Pg:";
         $hash{foo} = encode "UTF-8", "The teddybear costs \x{20ac} 45.95";

       Note  that using Encode will allow other binary data too where using
       the database encoding does not:

         $hash{foo} = pack "L>A*", time, encode "UTF-8", "Price: \x{20ac} 45.95";

   [1mNesting and deep structures[0m
       "Tie::Hash::DBD" stores keys and values as binary data. This means that
       all structure is lost when the data is stored and not available when
       the data is restored. To maintain deep structures, use the streamer
       option:

         tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", { str => "Storable" };

       Note that changes inside deep structures do not work. See "TODO".

[1mMETHODS[0m
   [1mdrop ()[0m
       If a table was used with persistence, the table will not be dropped
       when the "untie" is called.  Dropping can be forced using the "drop"
       method at any moment while the hash is tied:

         (tied %hash)->drop;

[1mPREREQUISITES[0m
       The only real prerequisite is DBI but of course that uses the DBD
       driver of your choice. Some drivers are (very) actively maintained.  Be
       sure to to use recent Modules.  DBD::SQLite for example seems to
       require version 1.29 or up.

[1mRESTRICTIONS and LIMITATIONS[0m
       • As Oracle does not allow BLOB, CLOB or LONG to be indexed or selected
         on, the keys will be converted to ASCII for Oracle. The maximum
         length for a converted key in Oracle is 4000 characters. The fact
         that the key has to be converted to ASCII representation,  also
         excludes "undef" as a valid key value.

         "DBD::Oracle" limits the size of BLOB-reads to 4kb by default, which
         is too small for reasonable data structures.  Tie::Hash::DBD locally
         raises this value to 4Mb, which is still an arbitrary limit.

       • "Storable" does not support persistence of perl types "IO", "REGEXP",
         "CODE", "FORMAT", and "GLOB".  Future extensions might implement some
         alternative streaming modules, like "Data::Dump::Streamer" or use
         mixin approaches that enable you to fit in your own.

       • Note that neither DBD::CSV nor DBD::Unify support "AutoCommit".

       • For now, Firebird does not support "TEXT" (or "CLOB") in
         DBD::Firebird at a level required by Tie::Hash::DBD. Neither does it
         support arbitrary length index on "VARCHAR" fields so it can neither
         be a primary key nor can it be the subject of a (unique) index hence
         large sets will be slow.

         Firebird support is stalled.

[1mTODO[0m
       Update on deep changes
         Currently,  nested structures do not get updated when it is an change
         in a deeper part.

           tie my %hash, "Tie::Hash::DBD", $dbh, { str => "Storable" };

           $hash{deep} = {
               int  => 1,
               str  => "foo",
               };

           $hash{deep}{int}++; # No effect :(

       Documentation
         Better document what the implications are of storing  [4mdata[24m content in
         a database and restoring that. It will not be fool proof.

       Mixins
         Maybe: implement a feature that would enable plugins or mixins to do
         the streaming or preservation of other data attributes.
